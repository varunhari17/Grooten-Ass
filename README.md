CSV File Uploading in php 

This is very interesting project, in which we have  Uploading CSV file data and then after before import into Mysql table we can edit CSV file data on web page by using jquery Ajax with PHP. Now what are benefits of this feature, because suppose we want to edit CSV file data then we can directly edit into CSV file and then after we can proceed for importing. But suppose you don't know there is some spelling error or any information is wrong in CSV file data and you have start upload CSV file for import data then you cannot stop importing process and wrong data will be directly import into Mysql table. But in this feature when you have upload CSV file for importing into Mysql table then on web page first it will display all CSV file data on web page in table format and you can edit any table column data before importing. So you after uploading file you can check all CSV file data on web page and if there is any wrong data is found then you can edit them and then after you can import into Database by using PHP with Ajax jQuery.
